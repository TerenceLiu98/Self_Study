    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, rapid advances in data collection and storage technology have enabled organizations to accumulate vast amounts of data. However, extracting useful information has proven extremely chanenging. The tradition dta analysis tools and technique cannot be used because of the massive size of a data set. Under this circumstance, new methods need to be developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually Dta mining is the **process of automatically discovering useful information in lagre daat repostiories**. This process can be separated into five part:\n",
    "1. Input data \n",
    "2. Data Preprocessing (Feature Selection, Dimensionality Reduction, Normalization, Data Subsetting)\n",
    "3. Data Mining \n",
    "4. Dta Postprocessing (Filtering Patterns, Visualization, Pattern Interpretation)\n",
    "5. Output \n",

    "## Classification: Basic Concepts, Decision Trees, and Model Evaluation \n",
    "\n",
    "Classification which is the task of assigning objects to one of several predefined categories, is a pervasive problem that encompasses many diverse applications. Classification techniques are most suited for predicting or describing data sets with binary or nominal categories. For instance, Example in *Introduction of  Data Mining*  4.2 shows how classification model works. \n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation of the performance of a classification model is based on the counts of test records correctly and incorrectly predicted by the model. These counts are tabulated in a table known as a **confusion matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} f_{11} & f_{10} \\\\ f_{01} & f_{00} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the total number of **correct predictions** made by the model is $(f_{11} + f_{00})$ and the total number of **incorrect predictions** is $(f_{10} + f_{01})$\n",

    "*where $0$ represents wrong and $1$ represents right*\n",

    "### Decision tree \n",
    "\n",
    "As the name said, 'Decision Tree' is a tree that can make decision, for instance, whether an animal is a mammal animal or not is depends on multiple conditions. Using the Decision Tree can help us make the classification / decision rapidly. *Decision Tree also can do the regression either.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind any decision tree algorithm is as follows: \n",
    "1. Select the best attribute using Attribute Selection Measures (ASM) to split the records \n",
    "2. Make that attribute a decision node and breaks the dataset into smaller subsets.\n",
    "3. Starts tree building by repeating this process recursively for each child until one of the condition will match:\\\n",
    "    * All the tuples belong to the same attribute value.\n",
    "    * There are no more remaining attributes.\n",
    "    * There are no more instances. \n",
    "    \n",
    "We use **Entropy** to evaluate which \"target\" should be the node. The concept of Entropy is generated by physics and it is a value to measure **the uncertainty of a system** . In information theory, it refers to the impurity in a group of examples and **Information Gain** computes the difference between before and after: $\\Delta \\text{Entropy}$.\n",
