    "As we have mentioned in `Using Python in Advanced Statistics`, **probability** is a number within in 0 to 1(included 0 and 1),and the meaning of probability is that the credibility(可信度) of a event or a prediction. According to this idea, **COnditional Probability** is the probability under some kinds of conditions. For example, if there is a rain tomorrow in Zhuhai. I check the data, found that in tomorrow's date, there are about 30% that will rain. **This is the probability**. If I want to know the possibility of rain tomorrow if it is already raining today. **This is the conditional probability**, which is a probability of an event happen based on a happened fact. \n",
    "\n",
    "The usual notation for conditional probability is $p(A\\mid B)$, which means under B event's condition, the probability of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "*PS: if the probability of an event is 0, we says it is **false**; in the opposite, if the probability is 1, it is **true**.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conjoint Probability \n",
    "\n",
    "After known what is **conditional probability**, we can easily know what is **conjoint probability**, which is another way to say the probability that two things are true. This time, the notation is: $p(A B)$ or $P(A\\ and \\ B)$."
